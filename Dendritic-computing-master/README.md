# Dendritic-computing

There are two code packages for our dendritic computing.
The MATLAB version is used to elaborate the details of the computing architecture and the algorithm.
The PyTorch version is used to effectively train the network.

The neural network with dendrite needs careful and skillful training. we are trying to learn from brain and looking for better training strategies.
